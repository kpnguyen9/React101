This is a react app that I worked on creating a blog app in order to get a better understanding of React and its hooks and components along with practice with Material UI. The app also uses a local database that stores blogs. This database can be changed to add or delete blogs depending on user choice. 

To use app:
  - download a copy of "Final" branch
  - npm start on one terminal
  - In another terminal, start a server for the db: npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000
